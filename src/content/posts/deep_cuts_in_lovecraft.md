“The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown”
― H.P. Lovecraft, Supernatural Horror in Literature

The First Incision
Hands trembling, you make the first cut revealing the tender red flesh


You are standing on a thin plane of existence, in the middle of a vast ever-expanding universe. Everything on this plane is explainable; physics deciphered, maths conquered, large stocks of biased human history consumed, you finally know it all. Then you step near the edge and peer into the yawning dark expanse. The slow burn of realization creeps up on you- You are insignificant. Infinite galaxies, nameless dark planets rolling without aim, and abysmal entities that have existed for billions of years; They are to humanity as you are to parasites that feed on your nutrition. Your fragile human mind shrivels in an attempt to grasp the sheer scale of the matter as it appears. You fall prey to the mortal curse that has doomed humanity ever since its genesis. You go insane. Writers of the supernatural and horror exploit this human weakness to write cosmic horror, the kind of horror that aims not just to scare the readers but to eventually drive them mad.

When H.P Lovecraft died at the young age of 47 years he knew that his fortuneless career as a writer of supernatural and horror stories managed to invent a whole new genre, but the people back in 1937 weren't just yet ready to appreciate the spectacle. Back then, people were already experiencing real-life horrors due to the world wars, they didn’t need any more horror in their lives. Instead, they turned to fantasies and comedies for shelter during tough times in the early 20th century. That's why artists like Charlie Chaplin and films like “The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)” were so popular. While horror stories of Lovecraft and many other artists got locked behind cheap magazines with perverse seductive covers produced only to cash in on male fantasies. 

But in 2022 almost 80 years later, artists with an interest in horror and supernatural literature praise Howard Philips Lovecraft, the mad prophet. As humans started venturing beyond the earth’s atmosphere it became evident that our race is but a small insignificant fragment of a much larger picture. The concept of morality doesn’t apply out there, nothing is good or bad, and everything just exists. Cosmic horror started making more sense. 

Writers were experimenting with the themes of cosmic horror long before Lovecraft was even born, but he was the one to coin the term. According to Lovecraft, cosmic horror stories deal with the forces of nature that are so far beyond mortal comprehension that there is nothing humans can do to deal with them. Often, the protagonists of these stories uncover some arcane knowledge that shatters their perception of reality and drives them insane. For example, in Lovecraft's 1928 short story ‘The Call of Cthulhu’ the protagonist Francis Wayland Thurston discovers a secretive pagan cult that worships a long-forgotten tentacle-faced anthropoid God called Cthulhu (pronounced as cloo-lu). As he digs deeper, his inquiry into the matter reveals an underground network of cults that commonly worship this entity. Presumably, Cthulhu sleeps in a mausoleum city under the sea and will someday rise again to enslave the earth.

“The Call Of Cthulhu” established major tropes that would serve as a checklist for future stories that involve some sort of alien vistas and beliefs painted over the stable veil of human perception: a bizarre and grotesque cult, a hint of the existence of an all-powerful god-like entity and a protagonist driven insane by revelations which were not meant for human purview - a perfect mix. Cthulhu was added to the already sprawling Lovecraftian mythos of gods and vistas which were beyond human comprehension. 

In 1927, Lovecraft entered the most prolific era of his career. In a span of six years, he produced some of his finest works like ‘The Call Of Cthulhu’, “The Dunwich Horror,” and the novellas “The Shadow over Innsmouth” and “At the Mountains of Madness”. All of Lovecraft's work went into the public domain following his death in 1937 as the writer had no offspring or blood relatives to pass his legacy to. August Derleth and Donald Wandrei, two of Lovecraft's close friends set up “Arkham publishing house” to preserve Lovecraft's works and to keep them in print, this venture didn’t turn out to be a profitable one.

H.P. Lovecraft

In the decades following Lovecraft's death, notable authors like Robert Bloch, Stephen King, Neil Gaiman, and Alan Moore started adopting elements from Lovecraft's mythos. By the turn of the 21st century, the Cthulhu Mythos had become a cultural phenomenon, spawning countless short stories, novels, video games, and board games, and inspiring a plethora of horror films. Sadly Lovecraft didn’t live long enough to witness the impact of his creations.

Lovecraft was not the only connoisseur of cosmic horror, artists were writing cosmic horror long before Lovecraft was even born. The King In Yellow, the 1895 short story collection by Robert W. Chambers is a series of ten short stories connected by a play named the same as the book’s title, the play is described as a work so artistically perfect and of malevolent powers that it drives the reader insane. Chamber’s The King In Yellow is rooted in reality, even though it portrays horror way differently than Lovecraft used to do but it philosophically aligns with the brand of cosmic horror. The horror stems from the madness and psychotic narcissism that the protagonists exhibit after reading the play, they lay down their masks and act true. Themes like these were adopted constantly by many other artists of that time like E.A. Poe, Algernon Blackwood, and Lord Dunsany. These writers filled Lovecraft’s imagination with horrid yet Recherche vistas that inspired him to create his own beautifully derelict dreamscapes.





The Second Incision

A curio, the second cut reveals an intricate web of throbbing veins


Stephen King in his 1981 book “Danse Macabre” discussed the necessary aspects of a great horror story. He argued that by altering the values of terror, horror, and revulsion one can experiment with the intensity of the delivery. You experience terror when You know something ill and foreboding lies beyond, but as yet it is unknowable and outside of your direct sensory information. For example, “the door at the far end of the dark hallway cracks open just a bit revealing the moss-covered room”. The horror comes when you come face to face with the threat,  it is the shock value of immediate dread that hits you. For example- “As you approach the room a dismembered corpse flings out the door”. And finally comes the revulsion, this is the gross and nauseating feeling that is often considered a cheap way to portray horror. For example, “Inspection of the corpse reveals throbbing pus-filled boils on its body”.

Cosmic horror spends all of its points on terror, with a heavy emphasis on showing the terrorized state of the protagonists. The mental state of the protagonist slowly deprecates and all you can do is witness their descent into madness. The horror stems from the realization that the human mind is a fragile thing, if it dwells too long on certain unexplainable thoughts the neocortex gets stuck in an infinite loop ultimately eliminating your consciousness. 

In Lovecraft’s 1936 novella “At the Mountains of Madness”, a group of scientists discovers vast alien cities buried beneath the ice of Antarctica and the awesome and awful survivors of its glorious past. The story is structured as a first-person narrative of a geologist, Dr. William Dyer. As the narrative comes to its end, Dyer’s speech is reduced to just fragments of a dreamlike situation. Whether the narrative of Dyer was a genuine one or just a rambling of a crazed old scientist, the readers are left to decide. Ponder too long on the question and you’ll become just like one of the protagonists of these stories, stuck in an endless pursuit of answering unexplainable questions.


The elder thing from “At the mountains of madness”

The intricate concepts and structure of cosmic horror have made it difficult to adapt it to the big screen. Countless visionary directors and filmmakers in the pursuit of adapting Cosmic horror stories have failed miserably either financially or artistically. One such ambitious attempt was the 1994 John Carpenter horror movie “Into the mouths of madness”, it follows John Trent, an insurance investigator tasked with finding the famed horror writer Sutter Cane. Trent’s search leads him to a small town that supposedly houses all of Sutter Cane’s fictional creations. The eerie similarities between the town and Sutter Cane’s writings slowly drive Trent mad. Even though the story complies with the Cosmic horror mix, it didn’t live up to the audience’s expectations because of its vague story. 
Back in 2006, Guillermo del Toro took up an ambitious but humongous project, the adaption of Lovecraft's “At the mountains of madness”. This pairing of del toro's storytelling abilities and Lovecraft's magnum opus seemed like a match made in heaven. However, the project has been stuck in film purgatory ever since 2006, when the script was first penned down. The screenplay adaption was never able to contain the grandiosity of Lovecraft's masterful writing. 
Showing the unthinkable and incomprehensible visually is a tricky task. It’s likely that the madness of these stories was never meant to reach a larger audience.




The Final Incision 

Terra incognita, the third cut bathes you in the blood of horrid vistas that were never meant to be borne by the human intellect. You put the scalpel down and turn back.


Carrying Lovecraft's legacy writers like Thomas Ligotti became the torchbearers for the genre after Lovecraft's death. The horror literature community soon started referring to Ligotti as the best-kept secret in horror fiction. Ligotti’s pessimistic and nihilistic visions for the human race resulted in bone-chilling short stories with fantastically crafted depraved worlds and protagonists. While Lovecraft's protagonists were scientists, victorian era professors, and scholars, Ligotti’s hapless characters were drifters, dreamers, and most of the time - nobodies. These characters didn’t fear the subversion of human knowledge, rather they embraced it. The protagonists rejoiced as the boundaries of their material world slowly melted away. Ligotti’s anthologies like the “Songs of a dead dreamer” and “Grimscribe”  feel like an illogical uncanny dream, there’s no explanation or context to the events happening. But the readers keep coming back to explore surreal worlds and grotesque dreamscapes, just like the protagonists in these stories who escape the banality of their square world and explore the outer limits of the human experience.

The most merciful thing that these protagonists of cosmic horror stories have been blessed with is the ability to ignore. When confronted with abysmal thoughts the characters can choose to ignore the revelations, but they go head-on into the rabbit hole and we, the readers always want them to do it. The cosmic ecstasy, the temporal high, we all crave it. But in real life if the sky blinks or if the winds speak, you will ignore for you fear the implications of being a stranger in a world full of men who are still sane.
